## Setup ##
-----------

Clone this repo. Create a copy of the default folder and add that folder name to the settings.gradle.

Make sure your Android Studio or IntelliJ has the kotlin plugin installed.
If you just installed it, restart the IDE.

Open a new project by selecting the root build.gradle.

Your module should be available and you should be able to run BowlingSpec.kt as a test class.

Your good to go.

## Kata ##
----------

The aim of the Kata is to code a function score that takes the rolls performed during a Bowling game and calculates the score.
The rolls are fed into one big list containing all of them. The tests covering all cases are already implemented to allow you to focus on the problem solving more than the tests cases needed.

The restriction you have is you are not allowed to have any local state in the form of variables/fields/properties.
You can break the problem in as many pieces as you want. Don't hesitate to ask for help on ideas and starting points.
