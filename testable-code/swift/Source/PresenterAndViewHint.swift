// if you get stuck, or don't know MVP very well, you can start with these hints to help you out.
// once you've extracted some methods out of the big bunch of code in ViewController.swift,
// think about which of those methods makes sense to be in a view (e.g. anything that displays
// anything), and what should be in a presenter (in this simple project, anything else :D )

//protocol View: class {
//
//}
//
//class Presenter {
//
//    private weak var view: View?
//
//    init(view: View) {
//        self.view = view
//    }
//
//    func beginPresenting() {
//        // this should probably do something...
//    }
//
//}
