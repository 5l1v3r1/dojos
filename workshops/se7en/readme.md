# 7 Languages in ~~14~~ 15 Weeks

Following [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks][book-link] by Bruce A. Tate, this is (yet another) attempt to get through the entire book at Novoda. It's 15 weeks because of one week delay starting, and two weeks per language because it'll help more people get involved considering schedules, and make it feel less like homework because it's at a more relaxed pace.

- You can drop in and out at anytime; if you don't have time to do a "day" or don't find language X interesting you can skip it, and join in with the next section.
- Create a new directory with your name inside the language directory and do your work in there. Please don't modify files in other directories except via PR.
- When you complete a "day" or section of work, please send a PR to master. Gives people a chance to see different solutions and promotes discussion. I'll merge and close all open PRs for the current language, when the next one starts.

Languages:
- ~~Ruby~~
- Io
- Prolog
- Scala
- Erlang
- Clojure
- Haskell

The schedule is listed in Google Calendar (7 Languages in 15 Weeks); if you can't see it, let me know and I'll share it with you.
